<p>Our Project will be a recration of Connect 4: “Connect-Four is a tic-tac-toe-like two-player game in which players alternately place pieces on a vertical board 7 columns across and 6 rows high. ... Both players begin with 21 identical pieces, and the first player to achieve a line of four connected pieces wins the game.” – mathworld.wolfram.com</p>
